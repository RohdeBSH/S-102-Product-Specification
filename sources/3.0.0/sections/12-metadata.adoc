== Metadata

//Since S-102 now describes a “navigation product” intended for ECDIS use: (a) ISO metadata files are not needed - ECDIS doesn’t have to read them; and (b) any “extra” metadata (metadata not defined in Part 17) should, at least in this edition, *not* be added to the exchange catalogue. If such extra metadata *has* to be provided, it should be as HDF5 attributes in the root group. (RM Comment 23Jan2023)

//With the removal of ISO metadata files, the metadata attributes in the old Sections 12.2 (Discovery metadata) and 12.3 (Structure metadata) are not encoded anywhere and these clauses have been deleted. The attributes depthCorrectionType and verticalUncertaintyType are also not encoded anywhere in the “navigation” version of S-102. (RM Comment 20 Mar 2023)

=== Introduction
The Metadata elements used in the Bathymetric Surface product are derived from S-100 and from <<iso-19115-1>> and <<iso-19115-2>>. Optionally additional metadata may be derived from <<iso-ts-19130>> and <<iso-ts-19130-2>> especially metadata relating to the sonar equipment which may have been used to acquire the bathymetric data.

S-102 metadata is encoded in two places:

* Metadata used for the discovery, identification, and use of S-102 datasets in S-100-based navigations systems (specifically, an S-100-capable ECDIS) is encoded in the exchange catalogue. This metadata conforms to S-100 Part 17, with product-specific restrictions added.

* Metadata required by the S-100 HDF5 encoding (<<iho-s100,part=10c>>) and product-specific metadata defined by this product specification are encoded at various levels in the HDF5 group hierarchy, as specified by <<iho-s100,part=10c>> or <<subsec-product-structure>>.

//Recommend either:
//(a) deletion of <<subsec-discovery-metadata>> and <<subsec-structure-metadata>>  along with Table 15 “S-102 Handling of Core Metadata Elements”, and try to encode any of their contents that are absolutely //essential described in the NOTE below;
//
//OR
//
//(b) Combine Table 15 and <<subsec-discovery-metadata>> and <<subsec-structure-metadata>> into a new clause (“Metadata in ISO format”) and make it clear that this is encoded as ISO-format metadata in a //separate ISO metadata file. (NB: ECDIS isn’t required to process this ISO metadata file - at most it would be displayed to the mariner as if it were any other XML //support file.)
//
//CATALOG.XML should conform to S-100 Part 17 with product-specific restrictions only (no extensions).
//
//NOTE: S-102 PT should review Table and <<subsec-discovery-metadata>> and <<subsec-structure-metadata>>  and determine which of their metadata *must* be included in S-102. Then add attributes (or datasets) to the root group, feature container group, or feature instance groups to encode that metadata, depending on whether it applies to all features, to a feature type, or feature instance. (Given that S-102 2.2 has only 2 feature types, it should probably be the root group, meaning it applies to all feature types and instances.)

//Above comments from RM circa 23Jan2023

[[subsec-exchange-set-metadata]]
=== Exchange Set metadata
For information exchange, there are several categories of metadata required: metadata about the overall Exchange Catalogue, metadata about each of the datasets contained in the Catalogue.

//<<subsec-exchange-set-metadata>> mixed exchange set structure with metadata, as does <<iho-s100,part=17>>, as did the old Part 4a in previous editions of S-100. Exchange set structure and metadata are different topics and the structure of the exchange set fits better as a new sub-clause of Clause 11 (Data Product Delivery) than it does under Clause 12 (Metadata) (or in a new top-level clause). Exchange set structure is now described in a new sub-clause of clause 11 and the diagram “realization of the exchange set classes” below is recommended for deletion. (RM comment 25Jan2023)

<<fig-components-and-associated-metadata-for-the-s102-exchange-set>> depicts the relationships of exchange set elements (datasets and feature/portrayal catalogues) and exchange set metadata. This figure is derived from Figure 17-2 in S-100 Edition 5.0.0 with relationships not applicable to S-102 omitted.

//We need to correct the S-100 reference to a proper one. (LH comment 7Feb2023)

<<fig-relationship-between-exchange-catalogue-discovery-metadata-and-dataset>> depicts the structure of the exchange catalogue and its component discovery metadata blocks. The structure is the same as in <<iho-s100,part=17>>.

More detailed information about the various classes is shown in in <<fig-s102-exchange-set-class-details>> and a textual description in <<tab-s102-exchangeCatalogue-params;to!tab-pt-locale-params>>.

The discovery metadata classes have numerous attributes which enable important information about the datasets to be examined without the need to process the data, for example, decrypt, decompress, load, etc. Other Catalogues can be included in the Exchange Set in support of the datasets such as Feature and Portrayal.

The following clauses define the mandatory and optional metadata needed for S-102. In some cases, the metadata may be repeated in a national language. If this is the case it is noted in the Remarks column.

The XML schemas for S-102 exchange catalogues will be available from the IHO Geospatial Information (GI) Registry and/or the S-100 GitHub site (https://github.com/IHO-S100WG).

The S-102 exchange catalogue uses the S-100 exchange catalogue schemas which are available from the S-100 schema server at https://schemas.s100dev.net (downloadable archives are also available on the site for offline use). Implementation of the S-102-specific constraints described in clauses 12.X to 12.Y below is left to developer decision as it can be done in various ways depending on implementation frameworks and the requirements of production or application software.

=== Language

The exchange language must be English.

Character strings must be encoded using the character set defined in <<iso-10646-1>>, in Unicode Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8). A BOM (byte order mark) must not be used.

=== S102_ExchangeCatalogue

Each Exchange Set has a single S100_ExchangeCatalogue which contains meta information for the data in the Exchange Set.

S-102 uses S100_ExchangeCatalogue without extension. S-102 restricts certain attributes and roles as described in <<tab-s102-exchangeCatalogue-params>>. These restrictions are in bold type and noted in the Remarks column.

S-102 exchange sets conforming to this edition of S-102 and using a CRS from the EPSG registry may be encoded as category 3 or 4 when the _compliancyCategory_ metadata attribute is populated. Because S-98 interoperability assumes _category4_ datasets, _category4_ may be used for test purposes, though the absence of test datasets and of a published IHO interoperability catalogue mean this edition of S-102 does not yet qualify for _category4_. *Given the uncertainty about interoperability testing requirements and availability of test datasets, the S-100 WG chair and S-102 PT chair should be consulted for up-to-date guidance.*

The class PT_Locale is defined in <<iso-19115-1>>. LanguageCode, CountryCode, and MD_CharacterSetCode are ISO codelists which are defined in a codelists file which is part of the S-100 Edition 5.0.0 schema distribution.

=== Certificates and Digital Signatures
The classes S100_SE_CertificateContainer, S100_SE_DigitalSignatureReference, and S100_DigitalSignatureValue are defined in <<iho-s100,part=15>> and implemented in the S-100 generic schemas.

In accordance with <<iho-s100,part=15>>, only the DSA algorithm is allowed from the S100_SE_DigitalSignatureReference enumeration.

S-102 uses S100_DigitalSignatureValue without modification. As stated in <<iho-s100,part=15,clause=15-8.11.4>>:

"The class S100_SE_DigitalSignatureValue is realized as one of either S100_SE_SignatureOnData (a digital signature of a particular identified resource) or an additional digital signature defined using the class S100_SE_AdditionalSignature, each of which is either a S100_SE_SignatureOnData or S100_SE_SignatureOnSignature element as described in clause 15-8.8. S-100 Part 17 metadata thus allows for multiple digital signatures, a single mandatory S100_SE_SignatureOnData and any number of additional signatures, either of the data or other signatures."
